This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error and its solution. The 'bug.ts' file contains code that attempts to pass an array to a function expecting a string.  'bugSolution.ts' shows how to fix this error by either modifying the function signature or appropriately handling the array input. This example highlights the importance of careful type checking in TypeScript to prevent runtime errors.
